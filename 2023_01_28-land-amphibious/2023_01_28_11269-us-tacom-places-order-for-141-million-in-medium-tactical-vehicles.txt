The US Army’s ground equipment supply has placed a $141 million order for more than 414 medium tactical vehicles with Oshkosh Defense.

The order announced on 18 January includes the FMTV A2 vehicles and 56 FMTV trailers for the US Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) Life Cycle Management Command.
Each tactical vehicle is designed to move troops, equipment and supplies, and recover other transport and weapon systems.
Oshkosh Defense chief programs officer Pat Williams said the FMTV A2 offers increased force protection, greater payload capacity, superior off-road mobility, enhanced engine power and an upgraded electrical system. 
“Since we were awarded the FMTV A2 production contract in 2018, we’ve worked closely with the US Army to refine the platform and add additional capabilities,” he said.
“We’re confident that we are delivering the best-performing medium tactical vehicle in the world.”
Oshkosh Defense has received orders for 1,412 FMTV A2s and 800 FMTV trailers for a total order value of $627 million to date.
