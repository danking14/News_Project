2023_01_28_11199-f-35-the-elevated-sensor.txt


- The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) plans to have a Full Operational Capability (FOC) with its Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II combat aircraft in late 2023. 
- The FOC milestone will see three operational squadrons and one training squadron fully established and equipped, and all base, training, and sustainment facilities completed.
- The RAAF is fielding an increasingly capable fleet of stand-off Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems.
- The F-35's advanced sensor suite referred to here will greatly enhance the RAAF’s ISR capabilities by providing a critical and unique combination of advanced sensors, communications, and effectors packaged in a single survivable platform.
- With unmatched, 5th Generation capabilities and full interoperability, the F-35 serves as the centrepiece of 21st century security for key allies in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.

2023_01_28_11217-former-us-marine-pilot-accused-of-training-chinese-aviators-under-extraordinary-pressure-in-custody.txt

- Daniel Edmund Duggan, the former US marine pilot at the centre of claims military aviators had been training the Chinese, is under "extraordinary pressure" in custody, his lawyer said on Tuesday.
- Dennis Miralis argued his client, who has multiple avenues to appeal including to the Federal and High courts, had been unfairly singled out for political gain and was innocent.
- It came on the day it was confirmed that Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus had approved a request from Washington to extradite the now-Australian citizen.
- Duggan is being held in the Silverwater jail in NSW, in a segregated area alongside terrorists. The matter is due before court again on 13 February.
- Miralis said in November, "In 22 years of practising criminal law with a specialisation in extradition, I have yet to see something as remarkable as this."

2023_01_28_11267-darpa-selects-partner-for-phase-2-of-crane-program.txt


- The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has selected Aurora Flight Sciences to move into the detailed design phase of the Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effectors (CRANE) program. 
- Phase 2 of the program will focus on detailed design and development of flight software and controls, culminating in a critical design review of an X-plane demonstrator that can fly without traditional moving flight controls on the exterior of the wings and tail. 
- DARPA’s CRANE program manager, Richard Wlezien, said, “Over the past several decades, the active flow control community has made significant advancements that enable the integration of active flow control technologies into advanced aircraft.” 
- The AFC suite of technologies enables multiple opportunities for aircraft performance improvements, such as elimination of moving control surfaces, drag reduction and high angle of attack flight, thicker wings for structural efficiency and increased fuel capacity, and simplified high-lift systems.
- DARPA’s CRANE program aims to design, build, and flight test a novel X-plane that incorporates AFC as a primary design consideration. CRANE seeks to optimise the benefits of active flow control by maturing technologies and design tools, and incorporating them early in the design process. AFC could improve aircraft performance by removing jointed surfaces, which currently drive design configurations that increase weight and mechanical complexity. Demonstrating AFC for stability and control in-flight would help open the design trade space for future military and commercial applications.
