The Royal Australian Air Force was able to show off 15 different aircraft in its fleet at the Avalon Airshow, including four different planes used for training pilots of every experience level.

The PC-21, PC-9A, Hawk 127 and F/A-18A-B Hornets were all on display at Avalon, with onlookers treated to an in-depth look at the aircraft used by the Air Force to prepare its pilots for a number of capabilities.
It wasn't just training capabilities on show though, with the RAAF demonstrating the next-generation of Australian and allied air combat capability, including the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.
The trade show days also provided an opportunity for the US, Japan and other allies to demonstrate their air fleets ranging from the KC-135 Stratotanker and B-52H Stratofortress to the next-generation F-22 Raptor and Kawasaki C-2 tactical transport aircraft.
It was also a chance for industry to reveal their own capabilities and demonstrations, including Boeing Defence, which in partnership with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) revealed a world-leading 'loyal wing man' unmanned aerial system concept, which will support Australia's future manned air combat systems.
