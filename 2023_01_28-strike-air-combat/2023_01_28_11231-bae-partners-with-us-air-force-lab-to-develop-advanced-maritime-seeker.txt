The US Air Force Research Laboratory has partnered with BAE Systems to lead the development, integration and testing of its multi-mode seeker for maritime strike applications for air-launched strike weapons systems. 

This US$12 million Phase 2 contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is to further develop a low cost, all-weather, multi-mode (radar/infrared) open architecture seeker under the Maritime Weapon Innovation Program (MWIP) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (also known as QUICKSINK).
Peter Dusaitis, chief scientist at BAE Systems’ FAST Labs, explained the importance of this development program, “Our seeker technology will greatly increase the warfighter’s capabilities, enabling combatant commanders with a new way to defend against maritime threats in a cost-effective manner. Our new multi-mode modular seeker enables precision identification and engagement of surface targets at great distances over a large area.”
QUICKSINK munition concept provides air-delivered maritime surface vessel defeat capability for the warfighter via a cost-effective precision-guided munition kit. The program aims to integrate the new seeker developed by BAE Systems’ FAST Labs research and development organisation. 
The Weapon Open Systems Architecture (WOSA)-compliant seeker is designed to be plug and play — providing semi-autonomous precision targeting of maritime surface vessels at low cost by retrofitting existing weapon systems to achieve torpedo-like seaworthy capabilities from the air.
