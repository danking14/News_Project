Northrop Grumman will develop the next-generation AN/APG-85, an advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar for the F-35 Lightning II, building on the company’s role in building the AN/APG-81 AESA fire control radar, the cornerstone to the F-35 sensor suite.

Northrop Grumman’s development and integration of APG-85 will incorporate some of the latest technologies available and help ensure air superiority. This advanced sensor will provide unparalleled battle space situational awareness that translates into platform lethality, effectiveness and survivability.
The AN/APG-85 is an advanced multifunction sensor that will be compatible with all variants of the F-35 aircraft and will be capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats.
Northrop Grumman plays a critical role in the development, modernisation, demonstration, production and sustainment of this multirole fighter, including:
 In addition to producing the AN/APG-85 and AN/APG-81 radars, the company manufactures the centre fuselage and wing skins for the aircraft, produces and maintains several sensor systems, avionics, mission systems and mission-planning software, pilot and maintainer training systems courseware, electronic warfare simulation test capability, and low-observable technologies.
Northrop Grumman is a technology company, focused on global security and human discovery. The company’s pioneering solutions equip customers with capabilities they need to connect, advance and protect the US and its allies.
