The Avalon 2019 Expo and Airshow provided an opportunity for defence and industry to display the next-generation capabilities that will transform the Royal Australian Air Force in coming years.

Air power established itself as the 'king of the battlefield' throughout the Second World War and as technology has evolved so too have air combat capabilities. The Avalon 2019 Expo and Airshow provided defence and industry with the opportunity to demonstrate the next-generation of Australian and allied air combat capability.
For the RAAF and broader Australian Defence Force, Avalon 2019 provided the opportunity to showcase a range of existing and emerging capabilities, from the tried and tested classic F/A-18A/B Hornets, which have been the backbone of the country's air combat capabilities since 1985, to the Navy's new MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk anti-submarine and anti-surface helicopters to the E/A-18G Growler and F-35A Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.
The Avalon trade show also saw a number of capability reveals and demonstrations from global primes, namely Boeing Defence, which in partnership with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) revealed a world-leading 'loyal wing man' unmanned aerial system concept, which will support Australia's future manned air combat systems. 
The trade show days also provided an opportunity for the US, Japan and other allies to demonstrate capabilities ranging from the KC-135 Stratotanker and B-52H Stratofortress to the next-generation F-22 Raptor and Kawasaki C-2 tactical transport aircraft.
